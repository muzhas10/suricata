Step 4: Configure Suricata 

4.1. List your network interfaces:

ip a
Sample output.

Note: Your network interface name may vary depending on your system. Be sure to use the correct interface name when editing the Suricata configuration file later in this lab. 


4.2. Change the HOME_NET variable to 10.10.10.20/32. This changes the HOME_NET IP address to the IP address of your Ubuntu endpoint. In addition set the E

sudo nano /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml


4.3. Update the af-packet interface to match your Ubuntu endpoint's network interface. In the same file (/etc/suricata/suricata.yaml), change the interface to the ens33 in the af-packet section. Save and exit.



Save the changes (CTRL + O)

4.4. Disable Community Rules 

Note: By default, Suricata reads rules from /var/lib/suricata/rules/suricata.rules. This file contains the active rule set downloaded using suricata-update. Community rules (like ET Open) are extremely useful and cover a wide range of threats, but they contain thousands of pre-written signatures, which can be overwhelming and hard to interpret at first.

In this lab, we will focus on creating our own custom Suricata rules to build a strong understanding of how basic detection works. To keep things simple and clear, we will temporarily disable the default community rules that typically generate thousands of alerts using pre-written signatures. Instead, we’ll write and use only our own rules, placing them in the /etc/suricata/rules/ directory.

This focused approach will help us master the essentials of how custom rules are structured, how they trigger alerts, and how Suricata responds without the noise. It’s a foundational step toward building confident detection skills in a real SOC environment.

Modify the rule-files section in /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml file. Comment out all built-in or community rules and only enable the custom rule file as follows::



Save changes and exit.

4.5. Run the following to validate Suricata configuration

sudo suricata -T -c /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml
You should see a success as shown below:



4.6. Enable Suricata to Start Automatically

sudo systemctl enable suricata
sudo systemctl start suricata
4.7. Verify Suricata is running 

sudo systemctl status suricata
Ensure it says “active (running)”.



Step 5: Monitor Alerts (Before Attacking) 

4.1 Verify Logging Is Working

Run:

sudo tail -f /var/log/suricata/fast.log
You should see no alerts yet > this confirms monitoring is ready.



Step 6: Launch Attack Simulations from Kali-Linux

After confirming Suricata is actively monitoring, simulate attacks to test the rules.

6.1. NMAP Scan Simulation

From Kali-Linux:

nmap -sS 10.10.10.20 
Sample output



Switch to the Ubuntu ubuntu-agent VM (the IDS sensor) and verify that Suricata successfully detected the Nmap scan.
Check the log file (/var/log/suricata/fast.log) for a corresponding alert. The following screenshot confirms that our IDS is actively monitoring and functioning as expected.

Sample output



Lab Evaluation Method 

All labs in this course are evaluated in class through instructor observation, hands-on demonstration, or brief discussion.

The instructor will review each student’s work during the lab session to verify task completion and understanding.

Feedback will be provided as needed, and students will have the opportunity to ask questions or clarify their process.

If the work is incomplete or not satisfactory, the instructor may ask the student to redo the lab.

A redo opportunity is available only if the student attends the lab session and actively participates.

Students are encouraged to ask for help. Doing so will not affect their evaluation.

Please refer to the lab-specific rubric for detailed evaluation criteria.
